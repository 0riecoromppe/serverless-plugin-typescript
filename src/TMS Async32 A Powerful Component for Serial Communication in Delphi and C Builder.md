# TMS Async32: A Powerful Component for Serial Communication in Delphi and C++ Builder
 
TMS Async32 is a set of efficient components that enable easy and fast connection to the serial port in Delphi and C++ Builder applications. It supports asynchronous serial communication, which means that the data transmission and reception can be done in the background without blocking the main thread of the application. This allows for high performance and responsiveness of the user interface.

TMS Async32 supports various serial port settings, such as baud rate, parity, data bits, stop bits, flow control, etc. It also provides methods and events for sending and receiving data, controlling the serial port status, handling errors and exceptions, etc. TMS Async32 can be used with any serial device, such as modems, printers, scanners, barcode readers, etc.
 
TMS Async32 is compatible with Delphi 5 to 10.2 Tokyo and C++ Builder 2007 to 10.2 Tokyo. It includes full source code and documentation, as well as demos and samples for various scenarios. TMS Async32 is a part of the TMS Component Pack, which is a collection of over 400 components for Delphi and C++ Builder.
 
TMS Async32 is available for purchase from the official website of TMS Software: [https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/async.asp](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/async.asp). The price is 95 EUR for a single developer license, or 295 EUR for a site license. TMS Software also offers free priority support through email and forum for registered users.
 
If you are looking for a reliable and easy-to-use component for serial communication in your Delphi or C++ Builder applications, you should definitely check out TMS Async32.
  
## Benefits of Serial Communication
 
Serial communication has several advantages over parallel communication, especially for long-distance and low-cost applications. Some of the benefits are:
 
- Serial communication requires fewer wires and connectors than parallel communication, which reduces the cost and complexity of the hardware.
- Serial communication can transmit data over longer distances without losing signal quality, as parallel communication is more prone to interference and attenuation.
- Serial communication can achieve higher data rates than parallel communication, as it avoids the problems of clock skew and synchronization among multiple channels.
- Serial communication can support multiple devices on a single bus, using techniques such as addressing, arbitration, and multiplexing.

## Types of Serial Communication
 
There are many types of serial communication protocols, each with its own characteristics and applications. Some of the most common ones are:

- UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter): This is a simple and widely used protocol that allows two devices to communicate asynchronously, without a shared clock signal. UART supports various settings such as baud rate, data length, parity bit, start bit, and stop bit.
- SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface): This is a synchronous protocol that allows one master device to communicate with one or more slave devices using four wires: clock, master out slave in (MOSI), master in slave out (MISO), and chip select (CS). SPI supports full-duplex communication and high data rates.
- I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit): This is a synchronous protocol that allows multiple master and slave devices to communicate using two wires: clock and data. I2C supports half-duplex communication and addressing of up to 127 devices on a single bus.

## Applications of Serial Communication
 
Serial communication is widely used in various fields and industries, such as:

- Computer peripherals: Many devices such as keyboards, mice, printers, scanners, webcams, etc. use serial communication protocols such as USB, PS/2, FireWire, etc. to connect to computers.
- Digital video: Many devices such as cameras, monitors, projectors, etc. use serial communication protocols such as HDMI, DVI, VGA, etc. to transmit digital video signals.
- Internet of Things: Many devices such as sensors, actuators, controllers, etc. use serial communication protocols such as UART, SPI, I2C, etc. to communicate with microcontrollers and other modules.
