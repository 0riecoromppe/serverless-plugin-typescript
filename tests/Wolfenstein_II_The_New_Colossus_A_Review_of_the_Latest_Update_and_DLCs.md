## The Deeds of Captain Wilkins
 
The Deeds of Captain Wilkins is the fifth and final DLC pack for Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. It was released on March 12, 2019 and it follows the story of Captain Gerald Wilkins, a veteran of the US Army who joins the resistance to stop a Nazi superweapon called the Sun Gun. The DLC features three new missions set in Alaska, where Wilkins has to infiltrate a Nazi base, sabotage their plans, and face off against a new enemy type: the Ãbersoldaten. The DLC also adds a new weapon to the game: the Sturmgewehr assault rifle, which can be customized with different attachments and skins.
 
The Deeds of Captain Wilkins is a satisfying conclusion to the Freedom Chronicles DLC series, which also includes The Adventures of Gunslinger Joe, The Diaries of Agent Silent Death, and The Amazing Deeds of Captain Wilkins. Each DLC pack focuses on a different resistance hero who fights against the Nazis in different locations and scenarios. The DLC packs are standalone stories that can be played separately from the main campaign, but they also add some background information and lore to the game's world. The DLC packs are available individually or as part of the Season Pass, which also includes some cosmetic items for the game.
